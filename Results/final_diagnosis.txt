### Final Diagnosis:

**Multidisciplinary Team Report**

After reviewing the reports from Cardiology, Psychology, and Pulmonology, our team has identified the following issues and recommended next steps:

* **Cardiac Structure and Function Issue** - Possible underlying cardiac conditions (Reason: Cardiologist report suggests possible cardiac causes, including mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which require further evaluation).
* **Anxiety and Panic Disorder Issue** - Possible anxiety-related symptoms, including panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (Reason: Psychologist report highlights family history and personal history of anxiety, and Pulmonologist report suggests anxiety-related respiratory symptoms).
* **Respiratory Symptoms Issue** - Possible hyperventilation syndrome, panic disorder-related respiratory symptoms, and GERD-related respiratory symptoms (Reason: Pulmonologist report suggests these conditions, and Cardiologist report mentions possible cardiac causes that could contribute to respiratory symptoms).
* **Hypertension Issue** - Possible hypertension (Reason: Cardiologist report recommends ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to assess for hypertension, which could contribute to cardiac and respiratory symptoms).
* **Orthostatic Intolerance Issue** - Possible orthostatic intolerance or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (Reason: Cardiologist report suggests consideration of tilt table test to evaluate for these conditions).
* **Coronary Artery Disease Issue** - Possible coronary artery disease (Reason: Cardiologist report recommends stress test or exercise tolerance test, cardiac MRI, and coronary artery computed tomography (CT) angiogram to evaluate for coronary artery disease).
* **Lifestyle and Stress Management Issue** - Possible inadequate stress management and lifestyle modifications (Reason: Psychologist report and Pulmonologist report recommend lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise, stress reduction techniques, and avoidance of triggers that exacerbate symptoms).

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation**:
	* Stress test or exercise tolerance test to evaluate for coronary artery disease or cardiac arrhythmias
	* Cardiac MRI to further evaluate cardiac structure and function
	* Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to assess for hypertension
	* Event monitor for longer-term monitoring of cardiac rhythm
	* Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to assess lung function
	* Methacholine challenge test to rule out asthma
2. **Psychological Evaluation and Therapy**:
	* Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychological evaluation to assess for panic disorder and other anxiety-related conditions
	* Consider cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based psychotherapies to address anxiety symptoms
3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
	* Encourage regular exercise, stress reduction techniques, and avoidance of triggers that exacerbate symptoms
	* Recommend mindfulness practices, stress management techniques, and relaxation techniques
4. **Medication Management**:
	* Consider alternative anxiolytics or stress management strategies
	* Collaborate with the patient's primary care physician to adjust medication regimen as needed
5. **Specialized Referrals**:
	* Referral to an electrophysiologist for further evaluation and management of potential arrhythmias
	* Consideration of coronary artery computed tomography (CT) angiogram to evaluate for coronary artery disease
	* Referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist to address underlying anxiety and panic disorder
6. **Monitoring and Follow-up**:
	* Monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust treatment plan as needed to ensure optimal management of anxiety symptoms and prevention of future episodes
	* Schedule regular follow-up appointments with the multidisciplinary team to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as needed.

By following these recommended next steps, our team aims to provide a comprehensive and coordinated approach to addressing the patient's complex medical and psychological issues.
